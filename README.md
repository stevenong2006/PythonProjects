# PythonProjects
## Purpose:
The primary purpose of these projects is to demonstrate how to use jupyter notebook for project documentation
## Projects overview:
- VectorMomentAboutAPoint: Apply numpy arrays to solve a engineer mechanic problem: vector moment about a point in Euclidian plan
- FFT_TimeDomain_to_FreqDomain: Apply numpy arrays and the numpy FFT to transform sinusoidal waveform in time domain to frequency domain
- PandasDfFromNamedTuple: One of the ways to create a pandas dataframe is from a list of named-tuple. The benefit is the fields in named-tuple will become columns' names in pandas dataframe.
