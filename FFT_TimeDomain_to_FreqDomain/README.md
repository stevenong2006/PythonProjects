# FFT_TimeDomain_to_FreqDomain
## Purpose:
- Use narray to generate sine-waveforms (signals) with different frequencies (i.e., 4Hz, 7Hz. & 9Hz)
- Plot these waveforms in (Amplitude vs Time) with each individual waveform in a separate graph using matplotlib
- Merge/combine the waveforms(signals) into one waveform(signal)
- Plot the combined waveform in (Amplitude vs Time) using matplotlib
- Transform the combined signal from time domain into frequency domain waveform using numpy's FFT
- Plot the transformed waveform in (Amplitude vs Frequency) using matplotlib
