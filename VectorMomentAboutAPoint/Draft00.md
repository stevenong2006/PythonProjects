## Solving a problem in engineer mechanics: Moment About a Point

### Moment of a Force About a Point (Scalar Calculations)
The moment of a force is the tendency of some forces to cause rotation. Any easy way to visualize the concept is set a box on smooth surface. If you were to apply a force to the center of the box, it would simply slide across the surface without rotating. If you were instead to push on one side of the box it will start rotating as it moves. Even though the forces have the same magnitude and the same direction, they cause different reactions. This is because the off center force has a different point of application, and exerts a moment about the center of the box, whereas the force on the center of the box does not exert a moment about the boxes center point.

### Elements of a Moment
The magnitude (scala) of the moment of a force acting about a point or axis is
directly proportinoal to the distance of the force from the point or axis.
It is defined as the product of the force (F) and the moment arm (d). The
<B>moment arm</B> or <B>lever arm</B> is the <u>perpendicular distance </u> between
the line of action of the force and the center of moments. <br>
<center>$ M  = F  *  d $<center>
