I don't own the python code in this project.
In learning the FFT library in numpy, I've found Jake Vanderplas' article
"Quantum Python: Animating the Schrodinger Equation" here: <br> https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python/

The dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system are governed by the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation: <br>
